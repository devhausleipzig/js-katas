## Getting Started

Before you start, we first need to install the application. This is done through the node package manager, short `npm`

```bash
npm install
```

After that you can start the application by running

```bash
npm start
```

This will start a live server that will serve the index.html page in the root directory and open the browser.
From there you can navigate to the individual lessons and challenges.
If you want to close the application go back to your terminal window and hit `ctrl+c`
