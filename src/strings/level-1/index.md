Take a look at the source code. Your job is to implement a fortune
teller function that will take in three arguments, a noun an
adjective and a plural noun and inserts them into a string.

You can either use string interpolation using the `` syntax or use
the + operator. Only change the return statement, the rest of the
code can stay untouched.

The template for the response message looks like this:

Those born under the planetary sign of the NOUN possess ADJECTIVE
personalities and are forever searching for new PLURAL_NOUN to
conquer.
